# Overview

## Code of Conduct

Below are the expected traits and behavior of UXh Members:

1. Be professional.
    * Professionalism is a requirement for users in this community. If you cannot conduct yourself well enough to fit the definition of a professional (regardless of titles), you will be asked to leave.
1. Be constructive.
    * Feedback and critique can be very sensitive instances of interaction between users. In our field, we need to be able to navigate these interactions tactfully and with taste. If you are unable to be constructive in the way you offer feedback, you will be asked to leave. If you are unable to recieve constructive critique without becoming defensive, you will be asked to leave.
1. Be willing to learn and improve, regardless of seniority.
    * This means leaving the ego at the door. There is no good reason that anyone at any level should deny the possibility for improvement in their craft or admit that there is another valid perspective. Serious absolutes will not be tolerated regarding the subjectives such as the creative process and the tools used in that process. If you prove with consistency that you are not maintaining an open mind, you will be asked to leave.

## Current State

### Discord Server

UXh currently exists solely as a discord community. Discord is the platform that UXh was created on and will always be an integral part of the larger organization. The only thing that stands to happen with the Discord server is that it will grow in userbase, quality of life, and organized activity.

Integrating Discord into the ecosystem of all future applications and devices is something that the community will have an active say and part in developing.

Discord offers a unique opportunity to utilize a generally casual and unprofessional platform that is enjoyable to use for a much wider purpose, and even shifting the nature of what Discord is to the people who visit this server.

### Website

We have a static [website](https://uxhouse.co) where people can find a sign-up form that sends out an email with an invite link to the server. Under active development is the infrastructure for content hosting and social media integration.

## General Goals

While UXhouse will always stay close to where it started, there are aspirations to be and provide more than just a place to hang out. The community was created with the intention to bring people together, but also to help those people further themselves in their passions and craft working within the umbrella of UX. Below are all the current plans for growth and their priority at this time.

### Now

* ~~Develop CoC for server and community in general.~~ Continue to build on CoC.
* Get more organic traffic and new users through the website.
    * Develop standards of outreach and inviting new users.
* Organize regular meetings within the community to cultivate more connectedness and improvement for users.
    * ~~Start a book club~~ Develop a list of reads to choose from.
    * Use some type of scheduling solution to get sessions scheduled.
    * Create a general udnerstanding of what we use these meetings for: peer review and general critique.
* Facilitate collaborative projects.
    * Write prompts/briefs to offer the community.

### Soon

* Establish branding.
* Develop a social media presence.
* Expansion of website to host results of collaborative efforts and educational content.

### Later

* Patreon integration to facilitate things like access to tools, access to educational resources, creation of content, advertising/outreach, etc.
* Establish design system.

## Expansion Efforts

### Objectives

* Continue to refactor and improve the structure of current facilities.
* Create/source informative and influential content regarding UX and everything it envelopes.
* Find as many ways to benefit the members of the community as possible.
* Keep original character of the community and quality of life close to the heart in all efforts.

## Conclusion

UXhouse is a wonderful community, it will always be a wonderful community, and it will garner growth because of that. The goals and objectives outlined in this document are all provisionary and open to discussion in order to provide the flexibility required to maintain the orginal integrity of what currently exists. Ultimately, there will never be a drastic, fundamental change to UXhouse without approval of the community itself.
